## Important Note Before Applying 📝

**⚠️ Avoid Generic Comments:**

Comments like:

🚫 *"Can I help on this one?"*

🚫 *"I’d love to contribute!"*

🚫 *"Checkout my profile!"*

🚫 *"Can I tackle this?"*

**Won't be considered**, and you **won't be assigned**.

Instead, provide a **clear explanation of your approach**, including:

- An introduction about yourself.
- A concise plan to solve the issue (6-8 lines max).
- Your estimated completion time (ETA).

---

## Steps to Contribute 🤝

### 1. Apply for an Issue
- Look for an open issue and comment expressing your interest to work on it.
- Wait for the maintainer to assign the issue to you.
- Apply only if you are confident in your ability to solve the issue.
- In your comment, include a quick introduction, your ETA, and your approach to tackle the issue.

### 2. Contact the Maintainer 📲
Once assigned, contact the maintainer via Telegram to confirm your assignment and share your brief plan.

- **perf:** A code change that improves performance
- **test:** Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- **build:** Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, npm)
